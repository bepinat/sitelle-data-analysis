Abstract:
     Observers at the National Optical Astronomy Observatories have
     provided spectrophotometry for 25 stars in the visual magnitude range
     7.5 to 16.6. This document describes the machine-readable version of
     their results as received from P. Massey. The magnitudes are on the
     Hayes-Latham system and cover the wavelength range from 3200 to 8100
     angstroms at approximately two angstrom intervals.


Description:
    The stellar magnitude system is based on the brightness of Vega at
    each wavelength. Vega, itself, has been compared accurately with
    laboratory standards. Unfortunately, Vega is much too bright to be
    observed under the same conditions with most stars of interest. Hence,
    various investigators have compared carefully with Vega and a few
    other primary standards somewhat fainter stars to be used as secondary
    standards. In addition, several much fainter stars have been used as
    tertiary standards with lower accuracy.

    With the common use of linear detectors and large telescopes, it has
    become important to provide spectrophotometric standards for a range
    of magnitudes including quite faint stars. The planning for the Hubble
    Space Telescope increased the necessity for fainter standards.
    Moreover, both the IUE and the HST require that the standards be
    established at the shortest wavelength reliably accessible from the
    ground so that ultraviolet spectrophotometry can be tied to visual
    spectrophotometry accurately.

    Investigators at Kitt Peak National Observatory have pursued a lengthy
    program to provide both more accurate spectrophotometry of faint stars
    and a dense distribution of the wavelengths at which the fluxes are
    measured. The close spacing of points is essential to place the fairly
    short stretches of a high resolution spectrum available with a solid
    state detector on a standard system.

    The present compilation provides improved data for nine stars
    previously observed by Stone (1977) or Oke (1974) and spectro-
    photometry of 16 new standards, eight of which are fainter than
    14.0 mag. To provide red standards and still avoid stars with numerous
    spectral lines, a highly reddened O5 star and two substantially
    reddened (but bright) O5 stars are included. The observations were all
    referenced to either BD+28 4211 or Feige 34. For four stars in common,
    comparison with the data from Stone indicates that the calibration of
    the standard stars is good to about 0.03 mag. The internal accuracy of
    the data for the individual stars is substantially higher. The
    measurements are on the Hayes-Latham system.

    Table 1 describes the stars. It is identical to Table 1 in the source
    reference except that V has been omitted. The number of observations
    per star ranges from 3 to 29, but not all observations were made under
    photometric conditions. Only one observation of Feige 110 was made
    under photometric conditions. For PG 0205+134, PG 0310+149, PG
    0939+262, PG 1121+145, and PG 1545+035, only two measurements were
    made under photometric conditions. The magnitudes for HZ44 show a
    large scatter within the 29 measurements. Fig. 1, also from the source
    reference, provides finding fields for all stars except for the two
    brightest.

Note on spectra:
    This file contains all 25 spectra as a single file. The information
    for each star begins with a header record. This record contains, in
    order, the star name, the number of data points, the wavelength of the
    first data pixel (in angstroms), and the wavelength per pixel. These
    header records are the only ones for which the first byte is not
    blank. The star name starts in byte 1 in the header; the remaining
    information follows in order with one or more blanks between each type
    of information but the format is otherwise not uniform. The remaining
    records before the next header record contain the data. Each magnitude
    has its decimal point in every seventh byte, starting with byte 4.

Historical Notes:
  * September 1991 at ADC: The Spectrophotometric Standards catalog was
    received from Dr. Massey in August 1987 in 25 machine-readable files,
    one for each star. These files have been concatenated into a
    single file. The documentation was written by Nancy G. Roman,
    Doc. No. NSSDC/WDC-A-R&S 91-09
    Files on the "Selected Astronomical Catalogs" Vol. 1 CD-ROM, directory
    /spectro/spstd
  * 11-Sep-1995: documentation standardized; individual files have been
    recreated to allow standard conversions into FITS of each spectrum.
